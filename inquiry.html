            <h1>Inquiry</h1>
            <p class="lead">The clarifying movement of the Field of Experience.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>Inquiry is the deliberate or spontaneous attempt to illuminate the structure of the field. It is not the mind asking questions; it is the field turning its attention inward to reveal what shapes it. Inquiry transforms pre-structured experience into conscious understanding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>1. Noticing</h3>
                    <p>A subtle deviation, tension, or sense of incompleteness becomes apparent. The field signals an unresolved formation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2. Following</h3>
                    <p>Attention stabilizes around the signal. Rather than analyzing, the field listens: What is here? What wants to reveal itself?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3. Unfolding</h3>
                    <p>Layers become visible. Emotional tones, assumptions, memories, projections, and pre-sensed possibilities surface in coherent relation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>4. Clarification</h3>
                    <p>The structure becomes intelligible. Understanding emerges, not as theory, but as direct perception of the field’s architecture.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • Realizing that discomfort in a conversation comes from a hidden expectation.<br>
                    • Tracking the origin of a recurring emotion back to its structural momentum.<br>
                    • Letting an intuitive question guide attention toward unnoticed dynamics.<br>
                    • Observing how the field reorganizes while being examined.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>Inquiry is not intervention; it is revelation. When the field sees its own structure, unnecessary constraints dissolve. Inquiry interrupts automatic repetition and creates openings for renewal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Inquiry is the field’s reflective capacity. It brings implicit structure into clarity, allowing experience to reorganize in more coherent, flexible, and authentic ways.</p>
