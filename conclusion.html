                <h2>Integration</h2>
                <p>The Field of Experience reveals itself as a single movement expressed through multiple layers—Curiosity, Memory, Projections, Cycle, Inquiry, Synthesis, and the Now. When these are recognized as dynamics of one field rather than separate functions, fragmentation dissolves. Experience becomes a fluid interplay of perception, influence, and unfolding potential.</p>
                <p>Integration is not an achievement but a recognition: the self is not a center but a coherence pattern within the field. Understanding reshapes orientation, and orientation dissolves into presence.</p>

                <h2>Implications</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experience is participatory—shaped through continuous interaction between perception and structure.</li>
                    <li>Clarity arises naturally from observing field dynamics rather than attempting to control them.</li>
                    <li>Inner conflict indicates misalignment within the field; it is an invitation to reorientation, not a defect.</li>
                    <li>Renewal is inherent whenever rigidity softens and curiosity reopens the field.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Living Framework</h2>
                <p>This framework is intentionally open. It is not a doctrine but an evolving architecture that adapts as new seekers, contexts, and inquiries emerge. Each cycle of understanding reshapes the field; each new perspective alters its coherence. The Field of Experience is therefore not fixed but continuously renewed through participation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Closing</h2>
                <p>All movements ultimately return to the Now—the site where the field becomes lived reality. The Field of Experience is understood not by conceptual mastery, but through presence with its living movement. To see the field is to participate in its unfolding with clarity, coherence, and openness.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The Conclusion brings the framework into coherence: the Field of Experience is dynamic, participatory, and self-renewing. Each layer expresses a facet of the same living field. As understanding deepens, experience aligns, and presence becomes transparent.</p>
