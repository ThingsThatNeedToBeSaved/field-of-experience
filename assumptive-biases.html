                    Pre-orientations of perception that shape how experience is
                    entered before it unfolds. These biases act as silent
                    lenses, influencing interpretation, tempo, and depth of
                    engagement.

                    <p class="summary">
                        Assumptive biases establish the initial contour of
                        experience. They are not distortions alone— they are
                        shaping forces that determine how the field opens,
                        contracts, or harmonizes at entry.

                    <h2>Types of Assumptive Biases</h2>

                    <h3>Negative Pre-Assumption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Entry through expectation of failure, conflict, or
                        deficiency. This bias reduces perceptual openness and
                        pre-activates tension structures.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Criticism Entry</h3>
                    <p>
                        Orientation through immediate evaluation or
                        fault-finding. Perception narrows to detect mismatch
                        rather than movement.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Harmonic Bias</h3>
                    <p>
                        Entry by assuming inherent coherence or alignment. This
                        creates fluidity but may obscure foundational detail.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Coherence Entry</h3>
                    <p>
                        Entering through assumed structural order. It stabilizes
                        perception but can create rigidity in interpretation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Glorification Bias</h3>
                    <p>
                        Entry through idealization, amplification, or elevation
                        of the other. It expands affect rapidly but distorts
                        appraisal and tempo.

                    <h2>Function in the Field</h2>
                    <p>
                        Assumptive biases determine <em>how</em> one arrives in
                        experience. They influence tempo, relational coupling,
                        perceptual aperture, and the capacity to sustain
                        clarity.
