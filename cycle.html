            <h1>The Cycle</h1>
            <p class="lead">The recurrent shaping-loop of the Field of Experience.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>The Cycle describes how the Field of Experience unfolds, stabilizes, anticipates, renews, and reshapes itself. It is not a linear sequence but a dynamic loop where each phase feeds the next: Curiosity → Structuring → Projection → Encounter → Revision → Renewal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>1. Opening (Curiosity)</h3>
                    <p>The field becomes permeable to new possibility. This initiates all change and movement.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2. Structuring (Memory)</h3>
                    <p>The field stabilizes into recognizable patterns. These patterns enable orientation and continuity.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3. Forward Lean (Projection)</h3>
                    <p>The field extends existing structures into anticipated futures, shaping perception before content arrives.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>4. Encounter (Perception)</h3>
                    <p>The world arrives. The field meets actuality, filtered through structure and projection.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>5. Revision (Update)</h3>
                    <p>A mismatch or confirmation alters the structure. The field adjusts to integrate the new encounter.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>6. Renewal (Return)</h3>
                    <p>The cycle returns to openness—curiosity is renewed, and the field becomes ready for another loop.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • Pausing before responding in conversation, subtly reshaping your stance.<br>
                    • Re-evaluating a belief after a surprising experience.<br>
                    • Returning to a familiar situation with a slightly altered sensitivity.<br>
                    • Feeling the shift from confusion to clarity as the field reorganizes.

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>The Cycle is the engine of aliveness. It describes how experience continuously updates without requiring deliberate effort. Disruption in any phase—rigid memory, overactive projection, weak curiosity—can freeze or distort the cycle, leading to stagnation, repetition, or fragmentation.</p>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The Cycle is the ongoing, looping process through which the Field of Experience evolves. It integrates openness, structure, anticipation, encounter, and renewal into a single living movement.</p>
