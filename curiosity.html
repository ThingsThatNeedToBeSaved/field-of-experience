            <h1>Curiosity</h1>
            <p class="lead">The initiating movement of the Field of Experience.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>Curiosity is the natural opening of the experiential field. It is the movement that precedes intention, choice, narrative, and evaluation. It is a pre-structured reach: a letting-through of possible experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>1. Pre-sensing</h3>
                    <p>The field registers a disturbance, hint, or possibility before the mind forms a question. This is curiosity as atmospheric: diffuse, unowned.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2. Orientation</h3>
                    <p>Attention begins to lean toward the sensed possibility. The field stabilizes around a direction.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3. Emergent Inquiry</h3>
                    <p>The shaping of the first question: What is this? What wants to be known here? This is where curiosity becomes a conscious gesture.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • The faint sense that something about a situation does not match memory.<br>
                    • The draw toward an unexpected emotional tone.<br>
                    • The subtle pause before responding in dialogue.<br>
                    • The interest that arises when something familiar appears slightly different.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>Curiosity does not demand content. It is the primary mode through which the field signals its openness to renewal. It is not the mind’s question but the field’s gesture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Curiosity is the primordial opening that allows the Field of Experience to move, evolve, and reshape itself. It precedes structure and invites the next formation.</p>
