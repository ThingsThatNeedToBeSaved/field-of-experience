                    <h2>Position in the Field</h2>
                    <p>
                        Withdrawal is a structural movement within the Field of
                        Experience. It does not initiate change, produce
                        insight, or resolve tension. Its function is
                        preservative. Identification is suspended when coherence
                        is at risk.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Withdrawal and Avoidance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Withdrawal is commonly misidentified as avoidance.
                        Structurally, they differ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Avoidance interrupts contact with experience. Withdrawal
                        maintains contact while suspending identification. The
                        field remains observed but unoccupied.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Conditions of Emergence</h2>
                    <p>Withdrawal emerges under specific conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Partial identification with fragments of orientation
                        </li>
                        <li>Contraction of identification anchors</li>
                        <li>Accelerated relational or conceptual charge</li>
                        <li>Formation of unstable identity constructions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Under these conditions, continued participation
                        amplifies distortion. Withdrawal collapses the unstable
                        structure without replacement.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Domains of Operation</h2>

                    <h3>Inward</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inwardly, withdrawal suspends identification with
                        beliefs, conclusions, or self-images generated through
                        inquiry. Thought remains observable without occupation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Relational</h3>
                    <p>
                        Relationally, withdrawal occurs when oscillations exceed
                        stabilizing capacity. Interaction pauses without
                        opposition, explanation, or disengagement.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conceptual</h3>
                    <p>
                        Conceptually, withdrawal applies to ideas, narratives,
                        and cultural frames. Structures are recognized without
                        adoption or negation.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Stabilizing Function</h2>
                    <p>
                        The stabilizing function of withdrawal is
                        non-constructive. No new orientation forms. No
                        correction is applied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unstable identity constructions collapse due to lack of
                        occupation. Prior coherence remains intact.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Non-Resolution</h2>
                    <p>
                        Withdrawal does not resolve tension. It does not
                        conclude inquiry. It does not determine outcome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Structures remain intact but uninhabited. Resolution, if
                        it occurs, arises independently.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Limits</h2>
                    <p>
                        When accumulated charge exceeds containment capacity,
                        withdrawal no longer stabilizes the field and other
                        movements emerge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Withdrawal suspends identification, not orientation;
                        one’s way of being remains available for participation.
                    </p>
