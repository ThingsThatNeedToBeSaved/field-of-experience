            <h1>The Now</h1>
            <p class="lead">The living convergence point of all movements within the Field of Experience.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>The Now is the direct expression of the entire Field of Experience as it becomes lived actuality. Curiosity, memory, projection, inquiry, cycle, and synthesis all unfold into a single experiential immediacy. The Now is not time—it is presence. It is the field as it is, before interpretation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>The Now is not a fleeting moment but a <em>mode of perceiving</em>. It is experience aligned with itself, free from the distortions of anticipation or recall. In the Now, the field appears as undivided actuality—nothing added, nothing withheld.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>
                <p>The Now arises through the convergence of all field dynamics:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Curiosity</strong> opens the front edge of possibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory</strong> provides the structural tendencies shaping interpretation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projection</strong> casts forward the expected shape of experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inquiry</strong> clarifies distortions and reveals underlying patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cycle</strong> maintains continuity and rhythmic flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Synthesis</strong> integrates coherence into orientation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Together, these movements fold seamlessly into the lived immediacy of the Now.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Modes of the Now</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Open Now:</strong> spacious, unresistant awareness; experience flows without constraint.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focused Now:</strong> high-resolution engagement with a specific aspect of experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disrupted Now:</strong> tension, fragmentation, or interference caused by conflicting structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resonant Now:</strong> alignment between internal dynamics and external circumstances.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • A task becoming fluid as thinking dissolves into direct action.<br>
                    • Anxiety constricting perception so the Now becomes filtered by projection.<br>
                    • Memory overshadowing immediacy, shaping the moment according to past meaning.<br>
                    • A moment of clarity when the field feels unified, unobstructed, and present.

                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Now is the only place where experience actually unfolds.</li>
                    <li>All layers of the field gain meaning only through their expression in the Now.</li>
                    <li>Presence cannot be produced; it is recognized when obstruction falls away.</li>
                    <li>The Now renews itself naturally when not conditioned by excess projection or memory.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The Now is the living event of the Field of Experience. It is the point of convergence where structure, openness, and coherence become actual life. The more unobstructed the Now, the more clarity, fluidity, and renewal the field expresses.</p>
