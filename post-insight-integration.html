                <p class="lead">
                    The delayed cycle through which an insight gained in
                    relational clarity becomes stabilized, tested, and
                    eventually integrated into lived structure. Integration
                    rarely happens in the moment — it unfolds in phases.

                <section class="essay-section">
                    <h2>Phase I — Immediate Encounter (Live Field)</h2>
                    <p class="summary">
                        High clarity creates temporary expansion: perception
                        sharpens, narrative thins, and structure becomes
                        illuminated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the moment of shared insight, the system registers
                        new structure but cannot yet assimilate it. The insight
                        becomes an internal
                        <em>insight object</em> — held, sensed, but not yet
                        owned.

                </section>

                <!-- Phase II -->
                <section class="essay-section">
                    <h2>Phase II — Retreat to Narrative (Stabilization)</h2>
                    <p class="summary">
                        Not regression. Not avoidance. A protective return to
                        familiar grounding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system retracts into narrative to restore identity
                        continuity. This retreat lowers tension and
                        re-establishes coherence after the intensity of live
                        clarity. The insight is not lost — only backgrounded.

                    <p>
                        Structural detail is too dense to hold. Instead, the
                        system stores:
                        <em>“This is real.”</em>
                        This compressed form persists in memory and waits for
                        activation.

                    <p class="summary">
                        A life event touches the insight’s domain — and the
                        “truth token” lights up.

                    <p>
                        Emotional charge returns in lighter form. Posture, tone,
                        and attention shift. This is the first private
                        re-meeting with the insight, without relational
                        pressure.

                    <p>
                        Through emotional sampling, cognitive simulation, and
                        somatic checking, the system evaluates whether the
                        insight coheres with existing identity structures.
                        Meaning-making begins here — not in the live encounter.

                        Small events in daily life serve as testing grounds.
                        Behavioral patterns, relational dynamics, and internal
                        states are compared to the insight’s logic. Only if the
                        insight “holds” at this level does integration become
                        possible.

                    <p>
                        Signs include reduced defensiveness, clearer language,
                        eased posture, and a subtle shift in interpretive
                        capacity. Integration is quiet — a clean internal
                        reorientation.

                        If the insight is too costly or destabilizing, it is

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “truth token” remains, but structure does not
                        integrate. This allows the person to preserve coherence
                        while avoiding disruption. It is a functional
                        compromise, not a failure.

                    <p>
                        The cycle can repeat across months or years. Each
                        reactivation increases the chance of full assimilation.
                        Nothing is lost — it only waits.
