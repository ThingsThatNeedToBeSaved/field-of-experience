The Field License (Version 1.1, 2025)

Copyright (c) 2025 The Field of Experience Contributors,
drawing on the countless voices, insights, and movements
that shaped the human field before us.


Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this work and associated documentation (“the Field”), to use, copy,
modify, merge, publish, distribute, and create derivative works, with the
following conditions:

1. Attribution
   A copy of this license must be included with all copies or substantial
   portions of the Field.

2. Freedom to Use
   The Field may be used for personal, educational, artistic, scientific,
   cultural, philosophical, or commercial purposes without restriction.

3. Surplus Responsibility
   If the Field or its derivatives generate financial profit that exceeds:
      (a) the creator’s living costs,
      (b) basic comfort and stability, and
      (c) authentic extraordinary ambitions—meaning pursuits of creation,
          exploration, or contribution that extend beyond ordinary life,

   then any remaining surplus profit should be directed toward regeneration
   projects.

   Extraordinary ambitions are self-defined and self-assessed. The Field does
   not judge or restrict the nature of such ambitions; it only distinguishes
   them from surplus.

   Regeneration projects include but are not limited to:
      • creating or protecting spaces where nature can exist unobserved and
        undisturbed,
      • ecological restoration,
      • long-term conservation efforts,
      • land preservation for non-human life.

4. No Obligation of Oversight
   The creator of the Field does not monitor, enforce, or supervise the use
   of surplus contributions. This license functions on trust, reciprocity,
   and voluntary alignment with the intent of the Field.

5. No Warranty
   The Field is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or
   implied. In no event shall the authors be liable for any claim or damage
   arising from the Field or its use.

By using the Field, you acknowledge this license and its intention: that
creative surplus becomes ecological renewal.
