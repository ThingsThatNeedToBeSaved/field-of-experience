            <h1>Memory</h1>
            <p class="lead">The stabilizing structure within the Field of Experience.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>Memory is not the past. It is the <em>active structuring</em> of the present field. Memory supplies coherence, identity, familiarity, and continuity. It is the field’s way of maintaining shape long enough for experience to be navigable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>1. Residual Patterns</h3>
                    <p>Impressions from prior experience remain as tendencies—felt orientations rather than stored data. Memory begins as atmospheric bias.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2. Structural Recall</h3>
                    <p>The field reconfigures itself according to previous formations. Recall is not retrieval but re-enactment: the pattern restabilizes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3. Narrative Assembly</h3>
                    <p>The mind constructs a coherent story from the reactivated structure. Memory becomes content only at this final stage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • Knowing how to respond to a familiar tone of voice without conscious recall.<br>
                    • Feeling déjà vu as a structural echo rather than a mental reference.<br>
                    • Automatically anticipating an outcome because the field has been shaped that way before.<br>
                    • Re-experiencing an emotional state before remembering its source.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>Memory is dynamic and relational. It is the field’s underlying inertia—the tendency to maintain coherence. Without memory, experience would be raw, unpatterned novelty; with too much memory, experience becomes mechanical repetition.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Memory is the ongoing structuring of experience. It is not static archive but living formation. Every moment of memory is a reconstruction, not a retrieval, shaping the present more than preserving the past.</p>
