            <h1>Comparative Cosmology</h1>
            <p class="lead">Cosmologies across history reflect the oscillatory movements of the experiential field.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>1. Cosmology as Field Dynamics</h2>
                <p>Cosmology is not merely a theory of origins but an expression of how the experiential field organizes itself. Historical cosmologies reveal oscillatory patterns—phases of coherence, tension, divergence, and reintegration. Through this lens, cosmology becomes a living rhythm rather than a fixed explanation.</p>
            </div>

                    <h3>2.1 The Oscillatory Field</h3>
                    <p>Experience moves through rhythmic oscillations: clarity and tension, logic and emotion, convergence and divergence. These polar movements are generative rather than oppositional. Cosmologies reflect these oscillations at the collective level.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2.2 Cosmology as Waveform</h3>
                    <p>Each cosmological era expresses a phase-state of the underlying field. Although surface forms change—mythic, rational, symbolic, empirical—the oscillatory principle guiding transitions remains constant.</p>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3.1 Early Mysticism — Coherent Phase</h3>
                    <p>Early mysticism expresses unity: emotional and logical dimensions operate in synchrony, generating low-tension cosmologies grounded in direct experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3.2 Institutional Mythologies — Tension Peak</h3>
                    <p>As societies expand, cosmologies formalize. Dualisms and rigid metaphysical systems appear. The field enters a divergence phase where structure overshadows experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3.3 The Rational Turn — Asymmetric Clarity</h3>
                    <p>The Scientific Revolution elevates logic while sidelining emotion and symbolic meaning. Precision increases, but the experiential spectrum narrows.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3.4 Romantic Re-entry — Rebalancing</h3>
                    <p>Romanticism, depth psychology, and phenomenology reintroduce subjective and symbolic dimensions. The field begins to reconverge toward balance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3.5 Fragmented Modernity — Chaotic Band</h3>
                    <p>Modernity generates multiple, incompatible cosmologies—scientific, psychological, sociological, digital. These coexist without integration, producing high-frequency oscillations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3.6 Emergent Integration — Toward a New Trough</h3>
                    <p>Contemporary integrative movements—complexity science, non-dual insight, somatics, systems theory—point toward an emerging clarity trough. The field prepares for reintegration.</p>

                    <h3>4.1 The Cosmological Mind</h3>
                    <p>Cosmologies reflect internal experiential structures. A fragmented psyche generates fragmented cosmology; a coherent psyche perceives coherence. The outer narrative mirrors the inner field.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>4.2 Divergence States</h3>
                    <p>When experience fragments, cosmological imagination becomes strained—symbolic overload, contradiction, and interpretive tension peak. The field expresses its divergence.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>4.3 Convergence States</h3>
                    <p>When clarity returns, emotional and logical dimensions synchronize. Insight stabilizes, and cosmological expression becomes coherent and integrative.</p>

                    <p>Harmonic cosmology views the experiential field as rhythmic. Clarity and tension arise naturally as part of a broader modulation.</p>

                    <h3>5.2 Cosmologies as Harmonic Expressions</h3>
                    <p>Across history, cosmologies appear as variations of the same underlying movement. Their forms differ, but their structural rhythms align.</p>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>5.3 The Function of Tension</h3>
                    <p>Tension signals the need for recalibration. It is not an error but a phase that prepares reorganization and the next clarity trough.</p>

                    <h3>6.1 Cosmology as Orientation</h3>
                    <p>In the harmonic model, cosmology serves as orientation rather than explanation. It helps contextualize how understanding takes shape within the field.</p>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>6.2 Experiential Field Literacy</h3>
                    <p>Recognizing oscillations—rather than identifying with them—develops field literacy. One learns to sense rising clarity, peak tension, and emergent integration.</p>

                    <h3>6.3 The Now in Cosmological Terms</h3>
                    <p>The Now is where all oscillations converge. It is the site of harmonic reorganization, where cosmology becomes lived immediacy rather than abstraction.</p>

                <h2>7. Conclusion — Cosmology as a Living Rhythm</h2>
                <p>Comparative cosmology reveals a dynamic rhythm underpinning humanity’s attempts to understand the world. Rather than competing explanations, cosmologies become phases in a larger movement—an oscillation of coherence and tension within the experiential field. This rhythm continues, shaping the cosmological possibilities of the present moment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Through the harmonic lens, cosmology is understood as rhythmic, participatory, and structurally patterned. Each era reflects a phase of the same oscillatory field. By observing these rhythms, clarity deepens—and the cosmological imagination becomes transparent to its own movements.</p>
