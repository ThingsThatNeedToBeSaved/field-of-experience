            <h1>Universal Principles of Existence</h1>
            <p class="lead">Structural movements that recur across all expressions of the experiential field.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>1. The Principle of Oscillation</h2>
                <p>Experience unfolds through rhythmic alternation—clarity/tension, expansion/contraction, convergence/divergence. Oscillation is the basic regulatory motion of the field, giving experience both form and movement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>2. The Principle of Emergence</h2>
                <p>Coherence arises not by force but by alignment. When tensions ease and movements synchronize, new insights, patterns, and orientations appear naturally. Emergence reveals the field’s intrinsic tendency toward organization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>3. The Principle of Reciprocity</h2>
                <p>Every movement contains a complementary movement. Perception shapes expression; expression shapes perception. The field functions relationally—no aspect exists in isolation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>4. The Principle of Continuity</h2>
                <p>Despite surface change, deeper structures persist. Patterns evolve through transformation, not replacement. Continuity provides the field with identity and coherence across time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>5. The Principle of Modulation</h2>
                <p>The field adapts by adjusting intensity, frequency, and coherence. Modulation allows experience to accommodate novelty, dissolve outdated structures, and reorganize fluidly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>6. The Principle of Integration</h2>
                <p>When disparate elements align, the field stabilizes. Integration brings complexity into harmony, allowing experience to feel unified without collapsing distinctions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>7. The Principle of Reflection</h2>
                <p>The field becomes visible through its expressions. What appears external often mirrors internal configuration. Reflection reveals the depth-relational nature of experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>8. The Principle of Renewal</h2>
                <p>Every cyclical movement contains a point of renewal where outdated formations loosen and new configurations emerge. Renewal is transformation through release, not erasure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>9. The Principle of Presence</h2>
                <p>All field movements converge in the Now. Presence is the living expression of the field’s dynamics—clarity, tension, insight, and transformation arising as a single, immediate event.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>These principles offer a structural vocabulary for understanding the dynamics of experience. They are not metaphysical claims but observational patterns—guides for perceiving how the field oscillates, aligns, and renews within every moment.</p>
