                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>Synthesis is the movement in which diverse elements of experience—memory, projection, sensation, insight, and context—come into coherent relation. It is not fusion or reduction but <em>alignment</em>: the field arranges itself so that what was fragmented becomes intelligible as a whole.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>1. Convergence</h3>
                    <p>Disparate threads of experience begin moving toward each other. The field senses that separate elements belong to a single configuration.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2. Coherence Formation</h3>
                    <p>Relationships become visible. Emotional tones, expectations, and memories line up into an intelligible structure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3. Integration</h3>
                    <p>The parts settle into a stable pattern that no longer feels contradictory. Insight becomes embodiment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>4. New Orientation</h3>
                    <p>The integrated structure offers a fresh direction. Decisions, perceptions, and possibilities shift accordingly.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • Realizing that several recurring emotions come from the same implicit belief.<br>
                    • Recognizing how memory and projection form a single loop in a specific situation.<br>
                    • Feeling various tensions resolve into clarity during reflection.<br>
                    • Seeing the "bigger picture" that organizes previously unrelated experiences.

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>Synthesis is how understanding becomes lived structure. It is not the end of inquiry but its transformation into orientation. When synthesis occurs, the field is more unified, less conflicted, and more capable of responding fluidly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Synthesis is the integrative movement in which the Field of Experience arranges its parts into coherent alignment. It transforms insight into embodied orientation and prepares the field for renewed openness.</p>
