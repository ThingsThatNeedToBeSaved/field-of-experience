                    Anchor Dynamics in Post-Insight Integration (PII)

                <p class="lead">
                    Post-Insight Integration unfolds through eight phases. How
                    each phase functions depends on the Identification Anchors —
                    somatic, temporal, narrative, relational, and identity.
                    These anchors determine the speed, depth, and stability of
                    integration.

                    <h2>Somatic Anchor</h2>
                    <p class="summary">
                        The body’s capacity for intensity determines how insight
                        is received, stabilized, re-activated, and ultimately
                        integrated.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Immediate Encounter</h3>
                    <p>
                        Regulated systems allow clarity to land; dysregulated
                        systems feel overwhelmed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Retreat</h3>
                    <p>
                        The body returns to familiar rhythms to re-establish
                        safety.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Memory Encoding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Somatic tone becomes part of the “truth token” stored in
                        memory.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reactivation</h3>
                    <p>Similar bodily states re-trigger the insight’s echo.</p>

                    <h3>Safe-Space Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Micro-tension and release help evaluate whether the
                        insight fits.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Application</h3>
                    <p>
                        Somatic alignment serves as evidence of truth or misfit.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Relaxation marks assimilation; tightness indicates
                        compartmentalization.

                    <h2>Temporal Anchor</h2>
                    <p class="summary">
                        One’s internal tempo governs the pace of assimilation
                        and the rhythm of insight reactivation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Immediate Encounter</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fast tempo grasps quickly but risks overload; slow tempo
                        absorbs gently with less detail.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Retreat</h3>
                    <p>Tempo resets to baseline safety.</p>

                    <p>Time slows; reflection becomes possible.</p>

                    <h3>Application</h3>
                    <p>
                        Daily tempo determines how the insight is tested in
                        lived moments.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tempo shifts as identity reorganizes;
                        compartmentalization freezes the insight in time.

                        Narrative provides explanatory cohesion. Insights
                        integrate only if they can be placed in story — or held
                        without story when narrative anchor is weak.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The insight becomes a simplified autobiographical

                    <h3>Integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Story reorganizes; or, if resisted, remains intact and
                        the insight is walled off.

                        The presence of the other is essential for insight
                        generation and strongly influences how and when insights
                        reactivate later.

                    <p>
                        Insight is stored with affective and interpersonal
