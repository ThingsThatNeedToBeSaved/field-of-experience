            <h1>Projections</h1>
            <p class="lead">The forward-casting dynamic of the Field of Experience.</p>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Essence</h2>
                <p>Projection is the field’s anticipatory movement. It extends existing structure into possible futures. It is not prediction but <em>pre-forming</em>—the way experience leans ahead of itself, shaping what will be perceived and how it will be interpreted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Mechanism</h2>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>1. Structural Momentum</h3>
                    <p>The field carries forward its current configuration. This momentum functions as expectation—implicit, often unnoticed, but influential.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>2. Anticipatory Framing</h3>
                    <p>Before content appears, the field shapes a frame: what is likely, what is relevant, what fits the current pattern. This determines what is even noticed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="layer-card">
                    <h3>3. Interpretive Projection</h3>
                    <p>The mind fills gaps based on these frames, generating interpretations that feel factual but are structurally inferred.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                    • Assuming a tone of voice implies a specific intention.<br>
                    • Expecting the next moment of an event to unfold like previous ones.<br>
                    • Seeing "what should be there" instead of what is.<br>
                    • Completing someone’s sentence internally before they speak.

            <div class="essay-section">
                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <p>Projection is essential for navigation and efficiency. It reduces complexity by narrowing the field to what seems probable. But unchecked projection can obscure novelty, distort perception, and create self-confirming loops. The field becomes a closed echo chamber.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Projections are the forward extensions of the field’s current structure. They determine what is noticed, how it is interpreted, and what futures feel available. Understanding projections reveals how much of experience is pre-shaped before perception.</p>
